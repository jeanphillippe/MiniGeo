# Isometric Tile-Based Game Development Steps

## Step 1: Basic Three.js Setup & Isometric Camera
**Goal**: Create the foundation with Three.js scene, isometric camera, and basic rendering loop
**Test**: Verify scene loads, camera works, and you can see a basic 3D environment

```html
- HTML5 boilerplate with Three.js CDN
- Scene, renderer, isometric camera setup
- Basic render loop (60fps target)
- Responsive canvas sizing
- Basic lighting (ambient + directional)
```

## Step 2: Grid-Based Terrain System
**Goal**: Create the 8-level height system with water, land, and mountain tiles
**Test**: Generate a visible grid with different colored tiles based on height levels

```html
- Grid generation system (configurable size)
- Height levels 0-7 with appropriate colors:
  * 0-1: Water (deep/shallow blue)
  * 2-5: Land (green variations)
  * 6-7: Mountains (gray/brown)
- Basic tile geometry (cubes/planes)
- Height-based positioning
```

## Step 3: Camera Controls & Mobile Input
**Goal**: Implement smooth camera movement with touch/mouse support
**Test**: Pan, zoom, and rotate camera on both desktop and mobile

```html
- Touch gesture handling (pan, pinch-zoom, tap)
- Mouse controls (WASD, wheel zoom, drag)
- Smooth camera interpolation
- Boundary constraints
- Mobile-first responsive behavior
```

## Step 4: Tile Height Editor
**Goal**: Toggle edit mode to modify terrain height by tapping tiles
**Test**: Click/tap tiles to raise/lower height, see visual changes immediately

```html
- Raycasting for tile selection
- Edit mode toggle
- Height modification system
- Visual feedback (highlights, shadows)
- Undo/redo functionality
```

## Step 5: Visual Style & Lighting
**Goal**: Apply Isla Historias aesthetic with proper lighting and colors
**Test**: Scene should look soft, rounded, with warm colors and good ambient lighting

```html
- Teal/turquoise sky background
- Cloud system (simple animated sprites)
- Soft shadow implementation
- Gradient lighting setup
- Warm color palette application
```

## Step 6: Basic Player Character
**Goal**: Add a moveable character with tap-to-move functionality
**Test**: Tap anywhere, character pathfinds and walks there smoothly

```html
- Simple character geometry/sprite
- Pathfinding algorithm (A* or simple grid-based)
- Smooth movement interpolation
- Basic walking animation
- Character positioning on grid
```

## Step 7: Sprite System Foundation
**Goal**: Create the sprite loading and rendering system
**Test**: Load and display a basic sprite sheet with configurable parameters

```html
- Sprite sheet loader
- Configurable sprite parameters (position, scale, frames)
- Layered rendering system
- Basic animation support
- 8-directional sprite support
```

## Step 8: Debug Interface for Sprites
**Goal**: On-screen controls for sprite parameter adjustment
**Test**: Real-time sprite position, scale, and animation tweaking

```html
- Debug UI panel (HTML overlay)
- Position controls (X, Y, Z sliders)
- Scale controls (width, height, depth)
- Animation frame selector
- Parameter copy-paste output
- Collision box visualization
```

## Step 9: Interaction System
**Goal**: Proximity-based interactions and tooltip system
**Test**: Approach objects, see context-sensitive tooltips appear

```html
- Proximity detection (2-3 tile radius)
- Tooltip system with HTML elements
- Context-sensitive messaging
- Smooth tooltip animations
- Object interaction triggers
```

## Step 10: Save/Load & Object Placement
**Goal**: Map editor functionality and persistence
**Test**: Place objects, save map to JSON, reload and verify everything appears correctly

```html
- Object placement system
- JSON map serialization
- Save/load functionality
- Interactive object library
- Map validation
```

## Step 11: Performance Optimization
**Goal**: Ensure 60fps on mobile devices
**Test**: Profile performance, optimize rendering, implement frustum culling

```html
- Frustum culling implementation
- Object pooling for sprites
- Render optimization
- Memory management
- Mobile performance profiling
```

## Step 12: Final Polish & SCSS Styling
**Goal**: Complete the UI styling and final touches
**Test**: Everything looks polished and professional

```scss
- SCSS compilation for UI elements
- Responsive breakpoints
- Animation transitions
- Loading states
- Error handling UI
```

## Implementation Notes:
- Each step builds on the previous ones
- Test thoroughly before moving to the next step
- Keep modules separate: Camera, Map, Player, Sprites, Input, UI
- Document sprite integration points clearly
- Prioritize mobile performance throughout

## Recommended Testing Flow:
1. Implement step
2. Test on desktop browser
3. Test on mobile device
4. Verify performance
5. Commit/save progress
6. Move to next step

Would you like me to start implementing Step 1, or would you prefer to begin with a different step?
